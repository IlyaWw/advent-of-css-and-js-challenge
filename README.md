# Advent of CSS and JS challenge

Here I tackle [#adventofcss](https://www.adventofcss.com/) and [#adventofjs](https://www.adventofjs.com/) challenges.
Use `npm start` script to run the app.
The challenges are rendered on different pages of a single app. Home page menu is a beautiful advent calendar copied from the adventofcss [website](https://www.adventofcss.com/)

## Challenge briefs

1. [Pomodoro timer](src/components/Pomodoro/README.md)
2. [eCommerce component](src/components/ECommerce/README.md)
3. [Piano keyboard](src/components/Piano/README.md)
